# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-- Peer-Graded Programming Project

It is used to run analysis on the target dataset, Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

# Source of the Dataset

# Files in this repository

1. CodeBook.md
- Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data 

2. run_analysis.R
- Performed the 5 required tasks
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. FinalTable.txt
- The finalized dataset after running the run_analysis.R

4. README.md
-  explains how all of the files work and how they are connected.
